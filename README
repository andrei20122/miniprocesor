task1
->for this task I thought of using a mask with the help of the variable m.
->with this mask I do not change the value received as input
-> the first 3 bits have a value of 7, and then the remaining 29 shifts to the left
-> with the help of the variable N we realize which is the number of instructions
-> I used the command you requested with scanf
-> in the repetitive structure (for) I took 2 bits each to decode
each operator separately
-> in size I went on the same principle as in N
-> I took the most insignificant 4 bits

task2
-> the beginning part is the same as in task1
-> and part of solving this task I used the logic from the previous task
-> with the help of the received formula I found out the number of operations and then I applied them later
-> in the first forum I read the values that had to be set,
there among the operators to be read
-> with the help of the second forum I did the default calculation
-> for this task I used 2 vectors (vec_operator and vec_operand)
